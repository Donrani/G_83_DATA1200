    <h2>Reflections on accessibility</h2>

    <p>An important principle when designing for accessibility is that the page should work for everyone, without need for adaptation. 
    This is something we wanted to implement when designing, and led to us making certain decisions: one of them was the choice to
    use a sans-serif font, to make it easier to read for everyone. We also made sure that there were sufficient colour contrasts, to
    improve readability. One last thing we did while coding, was to include captions for all pictures, to make the use of a
    screen reader easier. We also tried to make sure that the pages are structured in a logical way, with informative headings that 
    would make it logical to find the content you are looking for, while using a screen reader. 
    By taking these steps, we are hoping to make a website that is accessible for everyone. 
     </p>

    <h3>The results from the automated test</h3>

    <p>We testet our code, both the HTML and the CSS, on <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">this page</a> and
         <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator" target="_blank">this page</a>
        Our HTMl code had one major flaw, that the index page had two h1s. 
        The CSS code had no faults, according to the test. Even so, we actualle made some changes. The most important was to increase the 
        font size, because we felt that it was a bit small, even though the test found it fine. 
    </p>
    <h3>What have we done beyond automated testing?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, we actively thought about accessability when working on this page, in terms of font, shape and colour choices. 
    This was in some ways a challenge, because we could not just choose what we thought looked good, but had to consider the readability.
    At the same time, it made a lot of sense. Everyone likes information to be easy to understand, and font size, contrasts and other factors 
    are a big part of that. A well designed page is an accessible page! We think that this mindset is the reason the CSS had no faults, according to the test. 
    As this is a small project, we did not have time to test our website on many different users, which is something that might have
    improved the accessibility, and given us more insight. Testing is a fundamental part of universal design. Even so, we feel that 
our combination of preparation, though process while coding, and automated testing have made us able to design a page that is in many ways 
accessible.  </p>
