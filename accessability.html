        <h2>Reflections on accessibility</h2>

        <p>
          An important principle when designing for accessibility is that the
          page should work for everyone, without need for adaptation. This is
          something we wanted to implement when designing, and led to us making
          certain decisions: one of them was the choice to use a sans-serif
          font, to make it easier to read for everyone. We also made sure that
          there were sufficient colour contrasts, to improve readability. One
          last thing we did while coding, was to include captions for all
          pictures, to make the use of a screen reader easier. We also tried to
          make sure that the pages are structured in a logical way, with
          informative headings that would make it logical to find the content
          you are looking for, while using a screen reader. By taking these
          steps, we are hoping to make a website that is accessible for
          everyone.

          <h3>The results from the automated test</h3>

          <p>
            We testet our code, both the HTML and the CSS, on
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"
              >the HTML validator</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator"
              target="_blank"
              >CSS Validator</a
            >. Our HTML code had one major flaw, that the index page had two
            h1s. We though about changing The CSS code had no faults, according
            to the test. Even so, we actualle made some changes. The most
            important was to increase the font size, because we felt that it was
            a bit small, even though the test found it fine.

          <h3>What have we done beyond automated testing?</h3>
          <p>
            As mentioned above, we actively thought about accessability when
            working on this page, in terms of font, shape and colour choices.
            This was in some ways a challenge, because we could not just choose
            what we thought looked good, but had to consider the readability. At
            the same time, it made a lot of sense. Everyone likes information to
            be easy to understand, and font size, contrasts and other factors
            are a big part of that. A well designed page is an accessible page!
            We think that this mindset is the reason the CSS had no faults,
            according to the test. As this is a small project, we did not have
            time to test our website on many different users, which is something
            that might have improved the accessibility, and given us more
            insight. Testing is a fundamental part of universal design. Even so,
            we feel that our combination of preparation, though process while
            coding, and automated testing have made us able to design a page
            that is in many ways accessible.
