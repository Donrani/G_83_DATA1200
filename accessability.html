    <h2>Reflections on accessibility</h2>

    <p>An important principle when designing for accessibility is that the page should work for everyone, without need for adaptation. 
    This is something we wanted to implement when designing, and led to us making certain decisions: one of them was the choice to
    use a sans-serif font, to make it easier to read for everyone. We also made sure that there were sufficient colour contrasts, to
    improve readability. One last thing we did while coding, was to improve captions for all pictures, to make the use of a
    screen reader easier.

    <h3>The results from the automated test</h3>

    <p>We testet our code, both the HTML and the CSS, on <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"></a> and
         <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator" target="_blank"></a>
        Our HTMl code had one major flaw, that the index page had two h1s. 
        The CSS code had no faults. 
    </p>
    <h3>What have we done beyond automated testing?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, we actively thought about accessability when working on this page, in terms of font, shape and colour choices. 
    We think that this is the reason the CSS had no faults, according to the test. We 
    As this is a small project, we did not have time to test our website on many different users, which is something that might have
    improved the accessibility, and given us more insight. </p>
