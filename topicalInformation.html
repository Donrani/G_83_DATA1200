          To which extent and how does the internet have political consequences?

          <h3>The Norwegian election 2021 - an example</h3>
          <p>
            A few days ago, NRK wrote an article about political spending on ads
            on social media, which can be read
            <a
              href="https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/sa-mye-har-arbeiderpartiet_-senterpartiet_-hoyre-og-de-andre-store-brukt-pa-valgkamp-hos-facebook-1.15638270
            "
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >. Political advertisements are not permitted on Norwegian
            television, partially because they are considered too expensive, but
            they are all over the internet. Political parties advertise on
            Facebook and Instagram, and some politicians even do Tiktok dances
            to attract younger people. In our time, one might argue that the
            internet is a much bigger influence than television. We use web
            pages and different apps to gather information. The whole group has
            experienced targeted marketing from political parties, and we
            discussed how interesting it is to see who the algorithm thinks we
            are.

          <h4>Another Norwegian example</h4>
          <p>
            The effect of the internet on elections became very visible a few
            years ago, when NRK in the program “Folkeopplysningen” tried to
            manipulate a school election. Through targeted ads, fake Facebook
            events and other measures, they managed to have an impact on the
            election. This was very debated, and NRK was heavily criticized for
            the experiment. In an rticle on NRK, which you can read
            <a
              href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/folkeopplysningen-forsokte-a-manipulere-skolevalg-1.14686244"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >, the experiment is discussed. We think that while it was an
            interesting experiment, it really shows how easy it is to be
            manipulated.

          <h3>The American election in 2016</h3>
          <p>
            This discussion led us onto the theme of the US election in 2016.
            The company Cambrigde Analytica collected data on voters to help
            Trump's campaign. They claim that they were an instrumental part of
            Trump's victory. The methods they used to gather information might
            have been illegal, and they might have spread fake news to voters.
            More about the topic can be read on Wikipedia
            <a
              href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica"

            This is, in some way, the real life version of NRKs experiment. Our
            discussion, and the examples we provided, show how the internet may
            have political consequences, and how it may affect us all.
