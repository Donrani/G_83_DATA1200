<h1>To which extent and how does the internet have political consequences?</h1>
<h2>The Norwegian election - an example</h2>
<p>
A few days ago, NRK wrote an article about political spending on ads on social media, which can be read
 <a href="https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/sa-mye-har-arbeiderpartiet_-senterpartiet_-hoyre-og-de-andre-store-brukt-pa-valgkamp-hos-facebook-1.15638270
" target="_blank">here</a>.
Political advertisements are not permitted on Norwegian television, partially because they are considered too expensive, 
but they are all over the internet. Political parties advertise on Facebook and Instagram, and some politicians even do 
Tiktok dances to attract younger people. In our time, one might argue that the internet is a much bigger influence than 
television. We use web pages and different apps to gather information. The whole group has experienced targeted marketing 
from political parties, and we discussed how interesting it is to see who the algorithm thinks we are.

<h3>Another Norwegian example</h3>
<p>The effect of the internet on elections became very visible a few years ago, when NRK in the program “Folkeopplysningen” tried 
to manipulate a school election. Through targeted ads, fake Facebook events and other measures, they managed to have an impact on 
the election. This was very debated, and NRK was heavily criticized for the experiment, which you can read <a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/folkeopplysningen-forsokte-a-manipulere-skolevalg-1.14686244" target="_blank">here</a>.
 We think that while it was an interesting experiment, it really shows how easy it is to be manipulated.

<h2>The American election in 2016</h2>
<p>
This discussion led us onto the theme of the US election in 2016. The company Cambrigde Analytica collected data on voters to 
help Trump's campaign. They claim that they were an instrumental part of Trump's victory. The methods they used to gather 
information might have been illegal, and they might have spread fake news to voters. More about the topic can be read
 <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica" target="_blank">here</a> This is, in some way, 
the real life version of NRKs experiment. 
Our discussion, and the examples we provided, show how the internet may have political consequences, and how it may affect us all.
