Oppgave: 


Your website will contain the following pages:
1. Welcome! (index.html): this page should be a general information page
that helps the visitor understand what this site is, and navigate to the
other pages. May be short and simple. Common theme for site: Being a
first-year student (at OsloMet).

2. Reflection-essay: This page must contain a short text (500-700 words)
describing the challenges experienced by the (one, several or all)
members of the group when transitioning from upper-secondary school
(or work-life) to university. Reflect on any of the following topics:
a) learning to code, or
b) being a student rather than a pupil, or
c) managing the workload.
Please illustrate with screenshots of code or illustrating images if you
can. Else, we recommend using images of OsloMet to create a mix of
headings, paragraphs, and images for this page. We shall not assess the
language/grammar of the paragraphs. We expect headings, text and
images that relate to each other (content). Headings should be
informative and grammatically correct (proper visual hierarchy).

3. Accessibility page: It must contain a short presentation of accessibility
(up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for
accessibility using an automated test. Also explain how you checked,
validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an
automated test can do. You are welcome to use screenshots from the
testing site and of your code. We shall read this text! While the content of
your page is but a minor part of the assessment, this is the text that we
are certain to read. (Grammar not important.)

4. Topical information page: Technology and society (with external links):
Write – or re-use a short text you have previously written – (anywhere
from 300 to 1000 words) about technology and society. You are allowed
to reuse text from "DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers"
or other subjects. This text should have multiple links to external sites
with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the
information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to
be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.

5. Fun page: Make one page that is in a different layout and have a
different styling than the others. Put in some text and images. We accept
place-holder text, but don’t use copyrighted images. Or you can present
an activity or a place in Oslo. This page is an opportunity to be creative
and shine. You may embed video or sound, but again: beware of
copyright, please! Don’t forget to consider the size of the media files
(videos or pictures).
