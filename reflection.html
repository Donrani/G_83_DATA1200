      <h2>Learning to code</h2>
      <p>
        Learning to code has been a challenge for us. We have all been students
        before, so we are used to university life. Coding, however, was
        something totally new, and we had never done anything like it before. In
        this text, we will discuss how it has been. This semester we have tried
        both CSS/HTML and Java, which are very different in both form and use.
        Both the languages require effort and a lot of practice. Some of the
        group members prefer Java, and some prefer CSS/HTML.

        <h3>Learning Java</h3>
      <p>
        Java is very interesting, because there are so many possibilities. But
        at the same time, it is a totally new language and a new way of
        thinking. The very structured way to write the code craves a logical
        brain. Through the course, we have mainly written small programs, but it
        is easy to see the many ways one could use it. Those who prefer Java
        like that it requires less creativity and aesthetic sense, or at least
        another form of creativity. They also like that it is built up of
        logical building blocks. Those who struggle with Java feel that the
        programming is overwhelming, and that it is hard to understand where to
        begin.

        <h3>Learning CSS/HTML</h3>

      <p>
        Other group members prefer HTML/CSS, which is used to make and style web
        pages. The fun part about learning HTML and CSS is that it is so visual.
        Changing just a small thing in the stylesheet can have a big impact!
        This makes it very interesting, and it is easy to imagine that this is a
        skill that will be useful in many ways. Those who prefer HTML/CSS like
        that it is creative and visual, and feels more intuitive. Everyone has a
        relationship with web pages, and being able to design one's own feels
        exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many possibilities when you use CSS to style your page, and it
        is not always easy to get the result you want. We have all spent many
        frustrating hours in the stylesheet, trying to move a picture to where
        we want it. Suddenly something completely shifts, changes or disappears.
        Even though we feel more confident now, we are still not experts.
        Designing this web page, where we could decide everything ourselves, was
        both fun and hard. There were a lot of design decisions to be made, and
        we spent some time sketching on paper before we dared to start coding.
        As we worked on it, we had to make many decisions on the go, and
        discussed different solutions.

      <h3>Final reflections</h3>
      <p>
        As the webpage you now are visiting hows, we have learned more about coding, and have
        managed to make a web page. It is not perfect, but as a group with no
        former experience with web design at all, we are satisfied with it.
        Through the process, we have learned a lot, and we all want to continue
        coding in the future.
