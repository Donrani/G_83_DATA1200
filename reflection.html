<h1> Learning to code</h1>
<p>
Learning to code has been a challenge for us. We have all been students before, so we are used to university life. Coding, however, 
was something totally new, and we had never done anything like it before. In this text, we will discuss how it has been. This semester
we have tried both CSS/HTML and Java, which are very different in both form and use. Both the languages require effort and a lot of
practice. Some of the group members prefer Java, and some prefer CSS/HTML. 
</p>

<h2>Learning Java</h2>
<p>  
Java is very interesting, because there are so many possibilities. But at the same time, it is a totally new language and a new way of 
thinking. The very structured way to write the code craves a logical brain. Through the course, we have mainly written small programs,
but it is easy to see the many ways one could use it. Those who prefer Java like that it requires less creativity and aesthetic sense, 
or at least another form of creativity. They also like that it is built up of logical building blocks. Those who struggle with Java
feel that the programming is overwhelming, and that it is hard to understand where to begin. 
</p> 
<h2>Learning CSS/HTML</h2>
<p>
Other group members prefer HTML/CSS, which is used to make and style web pages. The fun part about learning HTML and CSS is that it
is so visual. Changing just a small thing in the stylesheet can have a big impact! This makes it very interesting, and it is easy to
imagine that this is a skill that will be useful in many ways. Those who prefer HTML/CSS like that it is creative and visual, and feels
more intuitive. Everyone has a relationship with web pages, and being able to design one's own feels exciting. 
</p>
<p>
There are many possibilities when you use CSS to style your page, and it is not always easy to get the result you want. We have all spent many 
frustrating hours in the stylesheet, trying to move a picture to where we want it. Suddenly something completely shifts, changes or 
disappears. Even though we feel more confident now, we are still not experts. Designing this web page, where we could decide everything
ourselves, was both fun and hard. There were a lot of design decisions to be made, and we spent some time sketching on paper before 
we dared to start coding. As we worked on it, we had to make many decisions on the go, and discussed different solutions. 
</p>
     
<h2>Final reflections</h2>
<p>
As this webpage shows, we have learned more about coding, and have managed to make a web page. It is not perfect, but as a group with 
no former experience with web design at all, we are satisfied with it. Through the process, we have learned a lot, and we all want to 
continue coding in the future.
